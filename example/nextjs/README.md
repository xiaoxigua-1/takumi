# Next.js Example

This is a simple example of how to use Takumi with Next.js.

Before running the example, you need to build the native library.

Make sure you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
cd takumi-napi-core
bun run build
```

Then, run the development server.

```bash
cd example/nextjs
bun run dev
```
