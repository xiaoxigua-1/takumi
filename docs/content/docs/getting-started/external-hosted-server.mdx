Takumi works well with [Node.js and Bun Integration](/docs/getting-started/nodejs), but when you get to a certain scale, you might want to decouple the actual rendering part from your application.

Or if you are not developing in JavaScript, like in Golang or Python, you might want to host Takumi as a standalone service.

## Concept

Since Takumi defines everything in JSON format, it's easy to distribute even without JavaScript runtime.

To offload rendering part from your application, you can expose this service to the public network with proper cache-control and integrity check setup.

## Installation

Takumi server is available as a Docker image on ghcr.io, you can start a container with volumes mounted to your fonts and images directory.

```bash
docker run \
  -v ./fonts:/fonts \
  -v ./images:/images \
  -p 5123:5123 \
  ghcr.io/kane50613/takumi-server:latest \
  --fonts /fonts \
  --images /images \
  --port 5123
```

### Options

- `--fonts` The path to the fonts directory.
- `--images` The path to the images directory.
- `--port` The port to listen on.
- `--draw-debug-border` Enables drawing of debug borders around elements.

If you are familiar with Rust, you can also check the [`Args` struct](https://github.com/kane50613/takumi/blob/master/takumi-server/src/args.rs) to understand the available options.

### Verify is it working

Once your container is running, you can verify it with curl.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5123/v1/image \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "width": 400,
    "height": 200,
    "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "content": "Hello, Takumi!",
        "fontSize": 24,
        "color": "#000000",
        "x": 20,
        "y": 20
      }
    ]
  }' \
  --output test-image.png
```

## API

Generate an image from a [node tree](/docs/deep-dives/building-layout).

### `GET /v1/metrics`

(WIP) Prometheus metrics.

### `GET /v1/health`

(WIP) Health check.
