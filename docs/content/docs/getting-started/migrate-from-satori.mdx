title: Migrate from Satori
description: Migrate from Satori to Takumi with your existing components.

Takumi aims to create a universal image generation library that can be used in any environment and not just limited to Node.js.

We still provide helper functions like [`fromJsx`](/docs/deep-dives/from-jsx-helper) to bridge the gap between JSX and Takumi nodes without refactoring the codebase.

<Callout>
This guide is for people plan to use Takumi in Node.js or Bun, if you are looking for WASM bindings, check out [Use Takumi in Browser (WASM)](/docs/getting-started/wasm-web) instead.
</Callout>

## Installation

```npm
npm i @takumi-rs/core @takumi-rs/helpers
```

## For Next.js `ImageResponse` users

<Callout>
Might be a `ImageResponse` breaking change in the future.
</Callout>

```diff
- import { ImageResponse } from "next/og";
+ import { fromJsx } from "@takumi-rs/helpers/jsx";
+ import { Renderer } from "@takumi-rs/core";

+ const renderer = new Renderer({
+  fonts: [/* Add your font buffers */],
+ });

function OgImage({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from {title}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export function GET(request: Request) {
-  return ImageResponse(<OgImage title="Satori" />);

+  const node = await fromJsx(<OgImage title="Takumi" />);
+  const buffer = await renderer.renderAsync(node, {
+    width: 1200,
+    height: 630,
+    format: "WebP",
+  });

+  return new Response(buffer as BodyInit, {
+    headers: {
+      "Content-Type": "image/webp",
+    },
+  });
```

Now you have an `GET` handler with Takumi setup!
