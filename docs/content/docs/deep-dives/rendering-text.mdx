description: How to load fonts and render styled text in Takumi
---

Takumi comes with pre-bundled fonts [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) and [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font) for `@takumi-rs/core`. This is to minimize the binary size for embedded Takumi versions.

## Supported Font Formats

- `ttf`
- `otf`
- `woff`
- `woff2`

Woff2 is recommended for environments which has file size constraint like [Cloudflare Workers](/docs/getting-started/cloudflare-workers) or Browser.

## Default Font fallback

Takumi appends every possible font family to the font stack when you load it in order, you can override this behavior by passing a `fontFamily` property to the node tree.

For `@takumi-rs/core`, the pre-bundled fonts will only load if the `fonts` array are not provided, or you can explicitly load them by passing `loadDefaultFonts: true` to the renderer constructor.
