title: Built-in Templates
description: No need to craft a component from scratch just to use Takumi.
---

Takumi comes with built-in templates for common use cases. It's available in JSX format, you can pass it to the [`fromJsx`](/docs/deep-dives/from-jsx-helper) function to convert it to a Takumi node.

The reason to use JSX is because it allows more people to contribute to the templates, and another benefit is you can take it to other usages like [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori).

## Installation

```npm
npm i @takumi-rs/template
```

## Usage

Just treat it as a normal React component.

```tsx
import DocsTemplateV1 from "@takumi-rs/template/docs-template-v1";
import { ImageResponse } from "@takumi-rs/image-response";

export function GET() {
  return new ImageResponse(<DocsTemplateV1 />, {
    width: 1200,
    height: 630,
    format: "webp",
  });
}
```

You can find all the templates in the [`takumi-template` folder](https://github.com/kane50613/takumi/tree/master/takumi-template/src/templates).

We need your help to improve and create more templates! Please feel free to submit PRs to add more templates.
