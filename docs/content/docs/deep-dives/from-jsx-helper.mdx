title: The fromJsx function
description: Turn React JSX components into Takumi nodes without the need to rewrite the entire component.
---

This function lowers the barrier for people coming from a similar project like [vercel/satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) to adopt Takumi.

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { fromJsx } from "@takumi-rs/helpers";

function SayHello({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ color: "#0000ff", fontSize: "20px" }}>
      Hello, {name}!
    </div>
  );
}

// Since there's no fragment node support, an array is returned.
// You should destructure the array to get the first node.
const [node] = fromJsx(<SayHello name="Takumi" />);

// You can then pass the node as a "root node" to render function
```

## How components are processed

The rules for this function are simple, you can just [look at the implementation](https://github.com/kane50613/takumi/blob/master/takumi-helpers/src/jsx/jsx.ts) to understand it.

1. React (Server) Components are resolved to their final values before processing.
2. `<img>` and `<svg>` elements become an Image node with style applied.
3. All other React elements become a Container node with style and [style presets](#styling-presets-for-common-elements) applied.
4. Rest of the primitive types (string/number) are automatically converted to Text node.

`props.style` is passed on to the container node as is.

## CSS Styling

### Styling Presets for Common Elements

Browsers like Chromium have [default stylesheets used to render HTML](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/master/Source/core/css/html.css). 

In order to maintain consistency across web and Takumi rendered images, we take reference from [vercel/satori Pre-defined styles for elements](https://github.com/vercel/satori/blob/main/src/handler/presets.ts) and then made [our own maintained presets](https://github.com/kane50613/takumi/blob/master/takumi-helpers/src/jsx/style-presets.ts).

### Style Parsing Compatibility

Takumi aims to support a wide range of CSS properties, but some advanced features may not be fully supported yet.

So you should always test your styles to ensure they render as expected.
