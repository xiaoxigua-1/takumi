title: From Satori
description: Migrate from Satori to Takumi with your existing components.
---

Takumi aims to create a universal image generation library that can be used in any environment and not just limited to JavaScript runtime.

We still provide helper functions like [`fromJsx`](/docs/deep-dives/from-jsx-helper) to bridge the gap between JSX and Takumi nodes without refactoring the codebase.

<Callout type="warning">
Takumi renders your nodes/components to rasterized images directly, we don't support rendering to SVG at this moment.
</Callout>

## Installation

```npm
npm i @takumi-rs/core @takumi-rs/helpers
```

<Callout>
Make sure to mark `@takumi-rs/core` as `external` if you are using a bundler like Vite or Webpack.
</Callout>

## Code changes

```diff
- import satori from "satori";
- import { Resvg } from "@resvg/resvg-js";
+ import { fromJsx } from "@takumi-rs/helpers/jsx";
+ import { Renderer } from "@takumi-rs/core";

+ const renderer = new Renderer({
+  fonts: [/* Add your font buffers */],
+ });

function OgImage({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from {title}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

-  const svg = await satori(<OgImage title="Satori" />);
-  const png = new Resvg(svg).render().asPng();

+  const node = await fromJsx(<OgImage title="Takumi" />);
+  const png = await renderer.renderAsync(node, {
+    width: 1200,
+    height: 630,
+    format: "Png",
+  });
```

Now you have Takumi setup!
